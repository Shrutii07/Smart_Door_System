# Smart_Door_System

An ESP32 controlled smart door system as a part of home automation is to be designed as follows. A touch button is mounted outside the home which is connected to ESP32 to enter the password in binary. Let the password of
the home be the 4-bit binary equivalent of the last digit of your roll number (If the last digit is 0, consider last but one digit). A user would be notified to enter the password by blinking on board blue LED 3 times. A user would be
given 4 sec time to enter the password; 1 sec per bit (tap). A tap/touch can be considered as 0 and untouched as 1 or vice-versa. The password would be matched with already saved in the code. If password is matched, a greeting should be opened in the browser screen showing
“Welcome Home Student Name ”.
